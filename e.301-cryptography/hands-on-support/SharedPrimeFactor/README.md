# Instructions

This challenge was originally published on [Seth David Schoen's webpage](http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/rsa/).
Here is the original Text accompanying this challenge:

> In the style of the Mystery Hunt and other contemporary puzzle hunts, the
> challenge eventually yields a specific answer that is a single word â€” but you'll
> have to figure out how to interpret the decrypted data to yield this word, since
> the RSA-decrypted data is itself in a non-RSA-related code. I'm not providing
> any specific instructions about what to do with the decrypted data beyond the
> fact that it can be interpreted as a reference to a single English word. (The
> answer word is a common noun, not a proper noun; if your guess at the answer is
> a proper noun, you haven't solved the puzzle all the way to the last step yet!)

We will be a bit more gentle and give you a bunch of scripts to work with, the
most important one being `./scripts/bgcd.sage` GLHF!
