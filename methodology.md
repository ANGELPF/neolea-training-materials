# Introduction

Cyber Security is becoming part of everyday life. So LEA needs to adapt in order
to enforce laws in the cyber space as well as in real life. This can not be left
untouched.

Adapting to cyber security requires new skills and tools that are sometimes hard
to acquire. LEA tend to "buy" equipment and solutions and this is a strategy
that can not really fly with cyber security. One is quickly outrunned when
posing as a customer in a fast-paced environment.

Security practitioners, by philosophy, and by necessity, tend to build the tools
required to do their job in the course of their daily activities. There is no
off the shelve solution for cyber-security. Threat Intelligence, Incident
Response, as well as Investigation in the cyber realm requires to engage with
the material at hand to gain a deep understanding of adversaries techniques.

Building software, often open source, therefore became increasingly important
for security practitioners. The tools they write enact from a need to thwart
fast evolving adversaries in a timely manner. Transposing this philosophical
stance to Law Enforcement Agencies and other Blue Light Agencies is a challenge
because of their culture shaped by the stability of their missions and
objectives. Fighting cyber-crime has often more resemblance to intelligence in
this methods, techniques and ways to deal with uncertainty, rather than fighting
crime in the streets.

Security practitioners possess knowledge, and a craftsmanship that can be
transposed to LEA. We discuss here in more details the methods we use to
determine the gaps in LEO training and tooling, the training needs, as well as
how we involve LEA in security communities to keep them sharp in their
fight against cyber crime.

# About Open Source Software in Security

It is not only about tools, it's also about competences.

# Training objectives

## What is the task we want LEO to be able to do
## What tools security do practitioners use to fulfill this task
## What are the fundamental knowledge required to use these tools
## What are the fundamental knowledge required enhance and adapt these tools to other use-cases

# Assessing training needs

## Know your audience

### What type of crime they are up against
### What are their daily-tasks
### What were their former training like
### What tools they use
What do they buy?
Why do they buy this?
What does this means regarding their skill?

## Know they need to know 

### Gap analysis
What is required - what they know = training needs

### What are the roadblocks

Performing training need analysis to understand gaps in LEO training straightforward in theory
but in practice, there are several challenges:

 - upfront, we usually only have access to line managers of the people that will
   be trained: LEA have hierarchies strictly defined and the people who decide
   about training are not the one taking the training. This mismatch often lead
   to discrepancies between what the trainers intend to convey and what the
   trainees' expectations. Remediation is to be found in the PMF loop explained
   below.
   
 - even if not ideal several agencies can take part to training sessions. This
   is actually the most challenging part of training planning and delivery as
   the trainer has to accommodate everyone while trainees have different goals,
   skills and motivations.
   
 - colliding philosophies: sometimes cyber security training requires to teach
   skills and knowledge that are frowned upon by LEO because of prejudices or
   because these are used by criminals and are part of what LEO have to fight
   against on a daily basis. This sometimes pose problems as trainees tend to
   reject the subject whereas mastering these skills can bring benefit.
   (Cryptography in one such subject for instance)
 
 - classified personnel: some personnel may keep a very low profile and no
   background information will be provided by their hierarchy beforehand.
 
## Preparing the training

One main aspect of training preparation is the selection of use-cases to present
during the training, and use-cases on which trainees will take a bite at. These
need to be engaging and display the usefulness of the tools. That is why the
best is usually to start with use-cases that trainers stumbled upon during their
daily jobs and found interesting. Also showing why certain use-cases called for
the development of new software features, and how the said features now make a
difference is a must.

Then comes the selection of use-cases that are part of trainees' daily jobs.
This may be some time challenging to define but trainers usually have an good
guess of what the trainee do by this time and can find several uses-cases the
trainees should be able to relate to.

In this preparation phase, the best is to develop additional features in the
tools to treat the specific use-cases. This software development is usually
continued during training in a PMF manner to display the agility of open source
software to the trainees (more on this in the PMF loop section below).

## PMF loop

The Programming Methodology Framework (PMF) describes a natural approach to
software engineering with a strong focus on the act of programming. In this
framework the management process is meant to be supporting the programming one
without impeding its progress.

The overall concept of PMF methodology follows the following process:

* Compose a list of features to be implemented and use an iterative programming process.
* Enhance said features using trial and error programming.
* Orchestrate your testing and integration processes using pragmatic programming.

In security, solving a problem almost always requires to write a piece of
software, or to articulating several piece of software together. Writing scripts
helps grasping the problem at hand by formalizing it. Therefore, learning how to
go into a PMF loop in one of the training objectives, regardless of the specific
matter at hand. LEO should engage in this process each time the bump into
issues, writing and bending software to achieve their goal, and sharing their
progress with their pairs and the community.

Training can therefore be adapted in a PMF manner during the sessions:
assessing the crowd to understand how the tool could be changed to better
accommodate trainees' need, what are the requirements, and how to change the
software to help solving it. The tool changes during the training and trainees
get the keys to jump into this PMF loop when back at the job.
