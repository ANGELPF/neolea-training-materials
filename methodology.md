# Introduction

As our societies becomes more and more reliant on digital technologies Cyber
Security is becoming part LEA daily duties to enforce laws in the cyber space
as well as in real life. Cyber space can not be left untouched any longer.

Adapting to cyber security requires new skills and tools that are sometimes
hard to acquire. LEA and companies in general tend to "buy" equipment and
solutions but this is a strategy that can not really fly with cyber security.
One is quickly outrunned when posing as a customer in a fast-paced environment. 

In cyber security more than anywhere success relies people, and how an
organisation can support them acquiring the required skills for the task at
hand.  LEA already provide such support to their officers in their core
activities but we believe progress can be made regarding cyber security
trainings.  The main goal of neolea is therefore transition from what is done
by LEA  now to what already works for security practitioners: gaining and
retaining skills and knowledge by building tools instead of buying them.

Indeed, security practitioners, by philosophy, and by necessity, tend to build
the tools required to do their job in the course of their daily activities.
There is no off the shelve solution for cyber-security that works. Threat
Intelligence, Incident Response, as well as Investigation in the cyber realm
requires to engage with the material at hand to gain a deep understanding of
adversaries techniques.

Building software, often open source, therefore became increasingly important
for security practitioners. The tools they write enact from a need to thwart
fast evolving adversaries in a timely manner. Transposing this philosophical
stance to Law Enforcement Agencies and other Blue Light Agencies is a challenge
because of their culture shaped by the stability of their missions and
objectives. Fighting cyber-crime has often more resemblance to intelligence in
this methods, techniques and ways to deal with uncertainty, rather than
fighting crime in the streets.

Security practitioners possess knowledge, and a craftsmanship that can be
transposed to LEA. We discuss here in more details the methods we use to
determine the gaps in LEO training and tooling, their training needs, as well
as how we involve LEA in security communities to keep them sharp in their fight
against cyber crime.

# Training objectives

## Assessing training needs

What is required - what they know = training needs

### Know your audience
*they, in this context, means LEA or affiliated*

- what type of crime they are up against?
- what are their daily-tasks?
- what were their former training like?
- what tools they use and what they buy?
- how do they select their tooling?
- what are the friction points / frustrations while working on cases?
- what are the cases that could have been resolve with better tooling?
- what workarounds did they find?
- what are the fundamental skills required to use these tools?
- what are documentation gaps in these tools?
- are they writing or customising tools?
- what can they teach us?
- how can they contribute back to open source projects?

### What are the roadblocks

Performing training need analysis to understand gaps in LEO training
straightforward in theory but in practice, there are several challenges:

 - upfront, we usually only have access to line managers of the people that will
   be trained: LEA have hierarchies strictly defined and the people who decide
   about training are not the one taking the training. This mismatch often lead
   to discrepancies between what the trainers intend to convey and what the
   trainees' expectations. Remediation is to be found in the PMF loop explained
   below.
   
 - even if not ideal, several agencies can take part to training sessions. This
   is actually the most challenging part of training planning and delivery as
   the trainer has to accommodate everyone while trainees have different goals,
   skills and motivations.
   
 - colliding philosophies: sometimes cyber security training requires to teach
   skills and knowledge that are frowned upon by LEO because of prejudices or
   because these are used by criminals and are part of what LEO have to fight
   against on a daily basis. This sometimes pose problems as trainees tend to
   reject the subject whereas mastering these skills can bring benefit.
   (Cryptography in one such subject for instance)
 
 - classified personnel: some personnel may keep a very low profile and no
   background information will be provided by their hierarchy beforehand.
 
## Preparing the training

One main aspect of training preparation is the selection of use-cases to
present during the training, and use-cases on which trainees will take a bite
at. These need to be engaging and display the usefulness of the tools. That is
why the best is usually to start with use-cases that trainers stumbled upon
during their daily jobs and found interesting. Also showing why certain
use-cases called for the development of new software features, and how the said
features now make a difference is a must.

Then comes the selection of use-cases that are part of trainees' daily jobs.
This may be some time challenging to define but trainers usually have an good
guess of what the trainee do by this time and can find several uses-cases the
trainees should be able to relate to.

In this preparation phase, the best is to develop additional features in the
tools to treat the specific use-cases. This software development is usually
continued during training in a PMF manner to display the agility of open source
software to the trainees (more on this in the PMF loop section below).

## The training

In neolea the training workflow is not foreseen to follow a script and be
linear but more to adapt continuously to the audience (see PMF loop below).
Therefore, the "ideal" agenda could be the following, but a fruitful training
usually branch out towards the trainees' interests and questions:

 - Teaching fundamentals
 - Presenting the tools and their goals
 - Use cases
 - Hands-on
 - Discussions

## PMF loop

The Programming Methodology Framework (PMF) describes a natural approach to
software engineering with a strong focus on the act of programming. In this
framework the management process is meant to be supporting the programming one
without impeding its progress.

The overall concept of PMF methodology follows the following process:

* Compose a list of features to be implemented and use an iterative programming process.
* Enhance said features using trial and error programming.
* Orchestrate your testing and integration processes using pragmatic programming.

In security, solving a problem almost always requires to write a piece of
software, or to articulating several piece of software together. Writing
scripts helps grasping the problem at hand by formalizing it. Therefore,
learning how to go into a PMF loop in one of the training objectives,
regardless of the specific matter at hand. LEO should engage in this process
each time the bump into issues, writing and bending software to achieve their
goal, and sharing their progress with their pairs and the community.

Training can therefore be adapted in a PMF manner during the sessions:
assessing the crowd to understand how the tool could be changed to better
accommodate trainees' need, what are the requirements, and how to change the
software to help solving it. The tool changes during the training and trainees
get the keys to jump into this PMF loop when back at the job.

# A strange loop

LEA's environment is continuously evolving and training must be reassessed
continuously.  This fact is what calls for a trial and error creation process
as described in the PMF loop. This model tries to formalise the constantly
evolving nature of cyber security training.
